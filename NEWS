Changes in 200?-??-?? edition:

* The operating system name for Solaris 7 is now "solaris7",
  not "solaris2.7" as in previous versions of config.guess and
  config.sub.  Similarly, Solaris 8 is now "solaris8", and
  Solaris 9 is now "solaris9".  This is for consistency with
  the terminology commonly used by Sun and others.

* We expect the next version of Solaris to be "solaris10",
  though we won't be sure of this until Sun's marketing
  department has its say.  Note that "solaris10" lexically
  sorts before "solaris9", just as "sunos5.10" sorts before
  "sunos5.9", so take care in your scripts.
