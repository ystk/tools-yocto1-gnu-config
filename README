The GNU Project's new "cryptographically signed upload" scripts do not
presently allow maintainers to overwrite existing files in-place on
ftp.gnu.org.  As a result, I was only able to upload signed copies of
config.guess and config.sub once!

For now, please fetch them from the following URLs:

 http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/*checkout*/config/config/config.guess
 http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/*checkout*/config/config/config.sub

Thanks,

Ben Elliston <bje@gnu.org>
